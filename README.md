# Shopping Assistant

This project is a **Shopping Assistant** that integrates **Flask, SerpAPI, Langchain, and IBM Watsonx.ai's Llama 3.1.70B** model. It is designed to refine user queries using **LLMs**, retrieve real-time product data via a **search engine API**, and generate structured outputs in a simple web application.

## Features
- **AI-Powered Query Refinement**: Enhances user queries for better search accuracy.
- **Real-Time Product Data Retrieval**: Uses SerpAPI to fetch up-to-date information.
- **LLM-Generated Structured Outputs**: Formats responses intelligently using IBM Watsonx.ai.
- **Modular Web Development**: Built with Flask for easy scalability and customization.

## Learning Outcomes
This project provides hands-on experience in:
- Combining **APIs and AI** for real-world applications.
- Implementing **query refinement and data integration**.
- Structuring **LLM-generated outputs**.
- Developing **modular web applications**.

## Future Scope
You can extend this project to:
- Enhance **search capabilities** with more data sources.
- Implement **voice-based interactions**.
- Integrate with **e-commerce platforms** for seamless shopping experiences.
